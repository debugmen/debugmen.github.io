# Fix me

## Overview
In this Challenge they give you a broken png, and based on the challenge title I need to fix the [png](/assets/tenable-2020/Fixme/fixme.png). (Save Link as. because the browser will try to render it)

```
$ feh fixme.png

libpng error: [27][FF][00][00]: invalid chunk type
feh WARNING: fixme.png_original - No Imlib2 loader for that file format
feh: No loadable images specified.
See 'man feh' for detailed usage information
```

## PNG Format
The PNG format is pretty simple. Its made of chunks that are broken up into length, type, and data sections, where length and type are both 4 bytes, and the data's length is described by the length value.

A PNG will have its `File header`, `IHDR` Chunk, then any ancillary chunks to describe things like pallete, gamma, etc, and finally a bunch of `IDAT` chunks with a `IEND` chunk at the end of the file.

## Investigating the PNG

010 Editor is an amazing tool and comes with predefined file type templates. When I ran the template it hit an issue parsing the file: *unknown chunk type at offset 0x53*. Lets checkout what's going on.

![010 Editor PNG 1](/assets/tenable-2020/Fixme/fixme_010.png)

Looks like theres invalid data in front of a `IDAT` chunk. Lets just try deleting it an see if our template works again.

010 parses out an `IDAT` chunk, but it looks like theres more trash data in front of the next `IDAT` chunk. Turns out this is the case for each `IDAT` chunk. I went and deleted the all those invalid bytes by hand for each `IDAT` chunk. This could have been scripted, but I had no clue if this was going to work when I was doing it.

Once I went through all that I tried viewing the image
